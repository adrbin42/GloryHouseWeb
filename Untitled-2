/**If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Every number below 1000 that is divisible by three
Every number below 1000 that is divisible by five
What is the sum of all these numbers?
